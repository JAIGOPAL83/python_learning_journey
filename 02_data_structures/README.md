# Python Data Structures

This section covers Python's built-in data structures and their operations.

## Topics Covered

1. **Lists (01_lists.py)**
   - Creating and accessing lists
   - List methods (append, extend, insert, remove)
   - List slicing and comprehensions
   - Sorting and searching

2. **Tuples (02_tuples.py)**
   - Creating and using tuples
   - Tuple packing and unpacking
   - Named tuples
   - Immutability concepts

3. **Dictionaries (03_dictionaries.py)**
   - Creating and accessing dictionaries
   - Dictionary methods
   - Dictionary comprehensions
   - Nested dictionaries

4. **Sets (04_sets.py)**
   - Creating and modifying sets
   - Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
   - Set comprehensions
   - Frozen sets

5. **Advanced Operations (05_advanced.py)**
   - List/Dictionary/Set comprehensions
   - Generator expressions
   - Working with nested data structures
   - Common algorithms with data structures

## Practice Exercises

1. **List Operations**
   - Create a function to remove duplicates from a list while preserving order
   - Implement a function to find the second largest number in a list
   - Write a program to merge and sort two lists

2. **Dictionary Operations**
   - Create a function to invert a dictionary (swap keys and values)
   - Implement a nested dictionary to represent a simple file system
   - Write a program to count word frequencies in a text

3. **Set Operations**
   - Find common elements between multiple lists using sets
   - Implement a function to check if two strings are anagrams
   - Create a program to track unique visitors to a website

4. **Combined Challenges**
   - Create a contact management system using dictionaries and lists
   - Implement a simple task scheduler using appropriate data structures
   - Build a basic inventory management system

## Tips for Working with Data Structures

1. Choose the right data structure for your needs:
   - Lists: Ordered collections of items
   - Tuples: Immutable sequences
   - Dictionaries: Key-value pairs
   - Sets: Unordered collections of unique items

2. Consider performance implications:
   - Lists: O(n) for searching, O(1) for append
   - Dictionaries: O(1) average case for access
   - Sets: O(1) average case for membership testing

3. Use built-in methods when possible
4. Leverage comprehensions for cleaner code
5. Consider memory usage for large datasets
